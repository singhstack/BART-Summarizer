# BART-Summarizer

Working on a text summarizer using BART (by FAIR).

Started with developing a flask application to define how the web--app will flow and to test my flask skills. So far so good.

Plan on using the hugging face transformer for the summarizer part. It truly is a one stop shop for a lot of NLP models including BERT, AlBERT etc. 

Looking forward to working on this.
